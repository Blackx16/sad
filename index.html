    <h1>System Analysis and Design - Unit I Notes</h1>
    <h2>Basic System Concepts</h2>
    <h3>1. Concept of a System</h3>
    <p>A system is an integrated collection of components that interact to achieve a common goal.</p>
    <p>Examples: educational system, computer system, solar system, etc.</p>
    <h3>2. Characteristics of a System</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Components</strong>: Interrelated elements or parts of a system (e.g., students, teachers in an education system).</li>
        <li><strong>Interaction and Structure</strong>: Components interact and form relationships within the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Goal</strong>: Systems have a purpose or objective.</li>
        <li><strong>Behavior</strong>: How a system reacts to its environment, guided by procedures.</li>
        <li><strong>Life Cycle</strong>: Systems have a life span that includes evolution, wear, obsolescence, and end.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Elements of a System</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Input</strong>: The energizing component on which the system operates (e.g., raw materials, information).</li>
        <li><strong>Processor</strong>: Transforms input into output (e.g., logical steps in a computer).</li>
        <li><strong>Output</strong>: The result of system operation, often different in form from the input.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. System Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Boundary and Environment</strong>: Defines what is inside and outside the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Subsystem</strong>: Smaller parts of a system that perform specific functions.</li>
        <li><strong>Interface</strong>: The interactions between subsystems.</li>
        <li><strong>Black-box</strong>: Subsystems whose internal processes are not visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Control</strong>: Mechanism for self-regulation by comparing outputs to standards.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>5. Types of Systems</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Conceptual and Physical Systems</strong>: Abstract ideas vs. operational systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Deterministic and Probabilistic Systems</strong>: Predictable vs. probabilistic outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Open and Closed Systems</strong>: Interaction with the environment vs. self-contained.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural and Artificial Systems</strong>: Naturally occurring vs. human-made systems.</li>
    </ul>
